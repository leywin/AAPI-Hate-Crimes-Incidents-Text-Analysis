# AAPI-Hate-Crimes-and-Incidents-Text-Analysis

APSTA-GE 2047 Messy Data and Machine Learning Final Project Spring 2021 

The goal of our study is to analyze the top 6 U.S. news media coverage on anti-Asian hate crimes and understand their efforts in combating against the rising tide of coronavirus-related discriminations and violence against Asian Americans. We performed some exploratory analysis on the Twitter data collected between March 2020 and March 2021 and trained two supervised machine learning models to classify whether the tweet is related to AAPI hate crime or not.
